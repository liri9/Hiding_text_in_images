Description
This application allows users to encode hidden messages within images using steganography techniques. 
Specifically, it embeds text into the least significant bits (LSBs) of the image pixels, making the alterations imperceptible to the naked eye.
The app provides a robust method to securely communicate information embedded within images.

Features
Encode Text: Hide text within images using LSB encoding.
Decode Text: Extract hidden text from images.
Image Support: Works with PNG images to prevent loss of data during the encoding process.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple UI to navigate easily between encoding and decoding functionalities.
